AJAX : Aynschronous Javascript And XML

A classic web application transmits data from the server to the client by "synchronous" requests.

For example, the client accesses a page by its URL, an then receives a response from the server.

Or, the client sends a form, which is received by the server, in POST (or GET), the server send the client a reply.

With AJAX, you can, for example, make sure the form is submitted and sent to the server, without the page being reloaded.
